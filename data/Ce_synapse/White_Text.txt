G., Southgate, E., Thomson, J. N. and Brenner, S. (1986).  "The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis  elegans", Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London B 314, pp.1-340.However some descriptions of PDA and PDB are given in the text of thepaper. On the basis of these descriptions, we provide the data of thesynaptic connectivities of PDA and PDB.================================= FORMAT OF DATA=================================The data consists of six columns. The format is similar to that of the data in "White_Table" directory (folder).[1st column] Name of reference neuron[2nd column] Name of partner neuron[3rd column] The number of singly contacted chemical synapses from the  reference neuron to the partner neuron[4th column] The number of singly contacted chemical synapses from the  partner neuron to the reference neuron[5th column] The number of multiply contacted chemical synapses from the  reference neuron to the partner neuron[6th column] Name of corecipients of the 5th column==================================== SYNAPTIC CONNECTIVITY DATA====================================PDA  PVN  1  -  -  -PDA  DA9  1  -  -  -PDA  HDC  1  -  -  -PDA  NMJ  2  -  -  -PDA  DD6  1  -  -  -PDA  DVB  -  1  -  -PDB  NMJ  -  -  2  DD6PDB  DD6  -  -  2  NMJ
