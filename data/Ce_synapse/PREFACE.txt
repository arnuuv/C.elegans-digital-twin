Indeed he wrote by himself computer software toreconstruct a neural system from cell morphology. He thought that someprinciples of neural wiring might be possibly discerned by that work (D.L. Riddle, T. Blumenthal, B. J. Meyer and J. R. Priess; p3 in C. elegansII, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1997). I believe that thestudies of synaptic connectivity of neurons in the pharynx by Albertsonand Thomson and those of remaining somatic neurons by White, Southgate,Thomson and Brenner are in line of that strategy of Sydney Brenner.For the ultimate success of the strategy, collaboration of neuralanatomist and computer scientist should be extended to studies ofbiological implication of the wiring. For that purpose, the illustrationin the papers of above mentioned authors, in which they illustratelocation of synapses on almost all neurons of hermaphrodite, should betransformed into digital data which is readable by a program forscientific computation. By the digital data, we can install the neuronwiring on computers and, by appropriate numerical simulation, the wormcan live on computers.In 1996, our project entitled by "Study of Biological InformationSystems by Models of Physical Complexity" started under the financialsupport from Japan Society of Promotion of Science (Project number:JSPS-RFTF 96I00102). Members of that research project had been disciplinedin various fields of computational physics and our ultimate goal was"transplantation of biological information system on a computer". Wehave referred to our core project with regard to the nervous system ofC. elegans as Cybernetic C. elegans Program (CCeP). Under that researchprogram, we digitized some features of the anatomical illustration andconstructed a database to be open to computer scientists. On the way ofthis work, we found that there had been already three databases, thedatabase constructed by Achacoso and Yamamoto, that by Durbin, and thatby WormBase ( http://www.wormbase.org ). We, however, found that theoriginal anatomical data includes more information than that digitizedby those people. In particular, we thought that information of locationof synapses on neurons will become important for the computationalresearch in future.In 1998, the first version of the database by CCeP appeared. During ourresearch program using this database, we discovered that synapticconnection in ventral cord was doubly counted in that database becauseof our erroneous interpretation of tables of synaptic connection inventral cord. The correction needed change of structure of the databaseand accordingly we should improve policy of constructing the database.On constructing its first version, we employed the policy that thedatabase should involve information in the original paper as it stands.We found during the work that the illustration of anatomical dataincludes some evidently erroneous descriptions and some of which ispossibly improved. We, however, did not improve it because we believedthat agreement with the original data is essentially important for thebasic database. It is the work of users to modify the data fileaccording to their own policy, if they find some inconvenience in thedatabase.On constructing the new version of database, another policy is added tothe previous one: The database should provide enough information bywhich the nerve ring illustrated in the original paper can be uniquelyreconstructed up to topology. Although precise scale of length is notknown, users can sketch the original illustration from the new versionof database. We expect that such structural information makes the wormtransplanted in computers more realistic.Dr. J. G. White assisted us on interpreting description in the Table inthe original paper. His assistance was very helpful and fruitful and forthat I express my gratitude to him.In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere thanks to K. Oshio,Y. Iwasaki, S. Morita, Y. Osana, S. Gomi, E. Akiyama, K. Omata and K. Okafor their laborious work and pay my respects to their completion ofconstructing the database.Kiyoshi KawamuraDepartment of Biosciences and Informatics, Faculty of Science and Technology,Keio University
