Sources ofdata are figures and tables in the two papers (Albertson and Thomson, 1976;White et al., 1986). Albertson and Thomson have described the synapticconnectivity among neurons in the pharynx while White et al. havedescribed that in the somatic nervous system except the pharynx. All thosedata are compiled in this database. It consists of three parts each ofwhich is equivalent to figures in the paper of Albertson and Thomson,figures in the paper of White et al. and tables in the same paper,respectively. We strongly recommend to use this database together withthese two papers.  --- References ---  Albertson, D. G. and Thomson, J. N. (1976).  "The Pharynx of Caenorhabditis elegans",  Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London B 275, pp.229-325.  Oshio, K., Morita, S., Osana, Y. and Oka, K. (1998).  "C. elegans synaptic connectivity data",  Technical Report of CCeP, Keio Future, No.1, Keio University.  White, J. G., Southgate, E., Thomson, J. N. and Brenner, S. (1986).  "The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis  elegans", Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London B 314, pp.1-340.The database is constructed under the following policies.  (a) There should be one-to-one correspondence between information      provided by the original papers and that described in various      files in the database.  (b) The database should provide necessary information so that everybody      can reconstruct the illustration in the original papers up to      topology.  (c) The database should provide sufficient information for any user      to edit their own data file according to their peculiar request.According to the policy (b), the geometrical information about the synapsesdepicted in the original papers is incorporated in the database (see"NOTE_WF.pdf" for details). Although several ambiguous or questionabledescriptions have been found in the original papers, we have not correctedthose descriptions.[*] Therefore the present data are just the same as thosein the original papers. Instead of correction, the policy (c) is employed.The policy (c) is realized in the comment index to point out ambiguous orquestionable descriptions in the original paper (see "README_AF.txt","README_WF.txt" and "README_WT.txt" for details). We leave users to decidehow to treat those ambiguous or questionable descriptions.[*] Only for the inconsistent data in the tables in White et al. (1986),we provide the corrected data in addition to the uncorrected original data.We have confirmed by a private communication with Dr. J. G. White that thecorrection is adequate. Refer to "README_WT.txt" for details.---Comment for users who have the previous database (Oshio et al., 1998):The differences between this database and the previous database are asfollows.  * Data denoted with neuron-class name (homologous neurons are summarized    as a neuron class) in the tables in White et al. (1986) and that in    the figures in Albertson and Thomson (1976).    - This database: We list the neuron-class name as denoted in the      papers. As for the data in the tables of White et al. (1986), we have      confirmed by private communication with Dr. J. G. White that the      present treatment is adequet.    - The previous database: Oshio et al. (1998) have interpreted the data      as a synaptic connection among the ipsilateral neurons. Accordingly,      some synapses were doubly counted.  * Format     - This database: We divide the database into three parts and their      formats are different from each other according to the format of the      original papers.    - The previous database: Format has been unified over all data from      three sources. * Comment index on misprints and data out of rules in the papers   - This database: We add a comment index for each corresponding data.   - The previous database: None.================================= FILES AND DIRECTORIES (FOLDERS)=================================The database has the following structure of files and directories(folders).

The symbol "se" represents a sensory                  neuron, "in" represents an interneuron, and "mo" represents                  a motor neuron.  o name_others.txt:      ASCII text file in which cells and tissue found in the database other than      neurons (muscle, neuromuscular junction, hypodermis and so on) are listed.  o White_Text.txt:      ASCII text file in which the synaptic connectivities of PDA and PDB are      given. Source of the data is the description in the text of White et al.      (1986).The data files of the synaptic connectivity and the related files aredistributed to the following three directories (folders).  o Albertson_Fig:      The data of the synaptic connectivity between neurons (classes) in      the pharynx, that is, the connectivity shown in the figures in      Albertson and Thomson (1976).  o White_Fig:       The data of the synaptic connectivity between neurons in the somatic      nervous system except the pharynx, that is, the connectivity shown in      the figures in White et al.
