G., Southgate, E., Thomson, J. N. and Brenner, S. (1986).  "The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis  elegans", Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London B 314, pp.1-340.In that paper, authors have studied the somatic nervous system except thatin the pharynx.================================= FILES AND DIRECTORIES (FOLDERS)================================= - [White_Fig] -----+- README_WF.txt                    +- NOTE_WF.pdf                    +- synapse_WF.txt                    +- process_WF.pdf                    |                    +- [neurons] --- XXX_WF.txt  o README_WF.txt:      This file. ASCII text file that gives general information on files      in this "White_Fig" directory (folder).  o NOTE_WF.pdf:      PDF file that illustrates the format of data in detail.  o synapse_WF.txt:      ASCII text file in which all of the data files "XXX_WF.txt" in the      "neurons" directory (folder) are included. For RMFL and RMFR neurons,      however, only "RMFL_WF.txt" and "RMFR_WF.txt" (the N2U reconstruction)      are included to make this file (see below for the reason).  o process_WF.pdf:      PDF file that illustrates the correspondence between the "process"      (branched morphology of neuron) and the index of process (2nd column      in the data files "synapse_WF.txt" and "XXX_WF.txt").  o XXX_WF.txt in the "neurons" directory (folder):      ASCII text files that describe the synaptic connectivity shown in the      figures in the original paper for each reference neuron. Here XXX      denotes a name of reference neuron.      In the original paper, RMF (RMFL/R) neurons are illustrated in two      figures. One illustrates neurons in the N2U series (adult hermaphrodite),      the other illustrates those in the JSH series (L4 larva). We provide in      "RMFL_WF.txt" and "RMFR_WF.txt" the N2U reconstruction while the JSH      reconstruction is provided in "RMFL_JSH_WF.txt" and "RMFR_JSH_WF.txt".================================= FORMAT OF DATA=================================To exactly list the synaptic connectivity shown in the figures in the originalpaper, we describe a synapse by the eight items which represent the followings.  (1) name of reference neuron  (2) the (branching) process of neuron  (3) location of a synaptic contact (a dot or a bar "|" illustrated in the original      paper) on the process  (4) which symbol of synapse type is attached to a synaptic contact?  (5) a type of synaptic contact  (6) name of partner neuron  (7) whether a synapse is multiple or not?  (8) comment on an ambiguous or questionable synaptic contactCorresponding to the eight items, the data files "synapse_WF.txt" and"XXX_WF.txt" consist of eight columns such as in the following table.     Table. Example of record in the database.-------------------------------------------------column   1       2    3    4   5   6       7  8-------------------------------------------------        ADAL     A    9    9   G  AVDR     -  -        ADAL     A   10   10   S  AVBR     -  -        ADAL     A   11   11   R  AIAL     *  --------------------------------------------------[1st column] Name of reference neuron[2nd column] Index of process:  Each process of neuron is labeled with an alphabet. When a neuron has  branched precesses, a process at the upper left-hand side of the original  figure is given priority in assignment of the index. Since the index is  assigned to the process without a synaptic contact, the index does not  always begin from the alphabet ``A'' in the database. Refer to the PDF  file "process_WF.pdf" for the correspondence between the present index  and the process illustrated in the original paper.  [3rd column] Serial number of synaptic contact:  All the synaptic contacts (illustrated with a dot or a bar "|" in the  original figures) on the process are numbered. Consecutive numbers are  used in a given reference neuron. From a combination of the 2nd column  (the index of process) and the 3rd column (the present number), location  of contacts on the process is known up to topology. Refer to "NOTE_WF.pdf"  for how to number the synaptic contact.[4th column] Serial number of synapse symbol:  All the symbols of synapse type (arrows and T lines in the original figures)  are numbered. Consecutive numbers are used in a given reference neuron.  Refer to "NOTE_WF.pdf" for how to number the symbol of synapse type.[5th column] Index of synapse type:  Synapse type is illustrated with an arrow (a chemical synapse) or a T  line (a gap junction) in the original figures. In the case of chemical  synapse, furthermore, "send" or "receive" is distinguished by the direction  of the arrow. We use four indices, "S", "R", "G" and "-" to describe the  synapse type.  "S": The reference neuron sends chemical synapse to its partner neuron.  "R": The reference neuron receives chemical synapse from its partner neuron.  "G": A gap junction connects the reference neuron with its partner neuron.  "-": A symbol of synapse type is missing.[6th column] Name of partner neuron listed in "name_neurons.txt" or others  listed in "name_others.txt".[7th column] Index to indicate that an asterisk is attached to the partner  neuron:  When a reference neuron receives multiple chemical synapses, only one of  its presynaptic partner neurons is explicitly written with an asterisk "*"  in the original figures. We use two indices, "*" and "-". In the case of  chemical synapse, therefore, multiple chemical synapses are distinguished  from a single chemical synapse by this index. In the case of gap junction,  the index should be "-".  "*": An asterisk is attached to the name of partner neuron.  "-": No asterisk is attached to the name of partner neuron.[8th column] Comment index:  When descriptions in the original figures are questionable, we have  commented in this column. We have classified the comments into 33 types,  and distinguish them by the following indices. Indices "wf1-5" are due  to deviations from the rules of the original paper.     "-": Nothing to comment.   "wf1": This is a presynaptic chemical synapse ("Send"), but an asterisk          is attached to the partner neuron in the original paper against          its rule.   "wf2": This is a postsynaptic chemical synapse ("Receive") with two or          more names of partner neurons. This may mean a multiple receive          synapse.   "wf3": This is a gap junction, but multiple names of partner neurons are          written in the original paper against its rule.   "wf4": This is a gap junction, but an asterisk is attached to the partner          neuron in the original paper against its rule.   "wf5": This is a gap junction between "*L" and "*R" neurons in the same          class. In the figure, the names of the two neurons are denoted for          the identical symbol of synapse type which is common to the two          neurons. The database of each neuron has two lines for this          connection, however, it means a gap junction between contralateral          neurons in the same neuron class.   "wf6": This is a gap junction between processes within the same neuron.   "wf7": No symbol of synapse type is attached in the original paper.   "wf8": No symbol of synapse type is attached in the original paper, but          the synaptic contact is illustrated with a bar "|" that often          represents a gap junction.   "wf9": The symbol of synapse type is illustrated with a left-right arrow.  "wf10": Multiple symbols of synapse types are corresponding to an identical          synaptic contact.  "wf11": "wf10" and "wf3".  "wf12": "wf10" and "wf7".  "wf13": Comment peculiar to RIPL. Boundary between RIPL and RIPR is not          clear in the original figure. It is possible that the synapse          lies on the process E of RIPR.  "wf14": Comment peculiar to RIBR. A symbol of this synaptic contact is          drawn over the boundary of two neurons. It is possible that the          synapse lies on the process F of RIBL (or RIBR).  "wf15": Comment peculiar to RIBL. From the same reason as above, it is          possible that the synapse lies on the process F of RIBR (or RIBL).  "wf16": Comment peculiar to SMBVL. Location of the synaptic contact is          erroneous. It is possible that index in column 5 is "R".  "wf17": The index of synapse type ("Send" or "Receive") is questionable          because the guiding line is ended between the symbol of synapse          type and the name of partner neuron in the original figure.  "wf18": "wf2" and that the index of synapse type ("Send" or "Receive") is          questionable because the guiding line is ended at the end of the          name of partner neuron in the original figure.  "wf19": The guiding line does not clearly point to the synaptic contact          in the original figure.  "wf20": "wf19" and "wf5".  "wf21": The name of partner neuron is not clearly printed in the original          figure.  "wf22": The asterisk is not clearly printed in the original figure.  "wf23": This synapse might be NMJ which is a special cases of chemical          synapses, however, the symbol of synapse type is illustrated          with that for "Gap junction".  "wf24": Comment peculiar to RMDR. The name of partner neuron "SVPL" does          not exist. It should be read "PVPL" or other names of neurons.  "wf25": Comment peculiar to RMGL. The name of partner neuron "RMVDL" does          not exist. It should be read "RMDVL" or other names of neurons.  "wf26": When distances of the several synaptic contacts from the soma seem          to be the same, the left (leftmost) synaptic contact is assigned           the smaller (smallest) serial number.  "wf27": The serial number of synaptic contact is not definitive, because          distances from the soma are not distinguishable due to gap junctions          usually marked with a bar "|" along process.  "wf28": "wf27" and "wf2".  "wf29": "wf27" and "wf3".  "wf30": "wf27" and "wf10".  "wf31": The N2U reconstruction of RMF (RMFL/R) neurons. The data is          included in "synapse_WF.txt".  "wf32": The JSH reconstruction of RMF (RMFL/R) neurons. The data is not          included in "synapse_WF.txt".  "wf33": "wf32" and "wf21".================================= DETAILED INFORMATION=================================Refer to "NOTE_WF.pdf" for more detailed information on the format of data.Example of the record in the database is also shown in "NOTE_WF.pdf".
